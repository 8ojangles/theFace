Hi Thomas,

I am writing to you as directed by your colleague, Louise Walsh, in relation to filing an appeal against the outcome of an official grievance I lodged previously. Please accept my apologies if this is not the correct method or medium for this appeal to be submitted. If an alternative method is required please let me know at your earliest convienience and I will endevour to comply.

As the letter of outcome and it's conclusion pertain to only one of the matters I raised this appeal will deal solely with that outcome. The other matters raised in the grievance, whilst connected, will be lodged in seperate grievances as I would require an official response to those before I consider further options available to me.

The letter informing me of the commencement of suspension and disciplinary investigation states clearly and repeatedly:
"To ensure that the investigation can be conducted as fairly as possible we request that you keep the matter confidential".
Further disciplinary action is sanctioned against me for any breach of this condition.

In the conclusion of the outcome to the grievance I lodged, Louise states:

"If the decision is taken to move into the disciplinary procedure I am confident based on the steps of the Company disciplinary policy [oulined below] that a full and fair procedure will be followed."
and
"Therefore, I do not believe the process has been compromised."

That the process itself is fair is self-evident, as a direct copy of the procedure set out by ACAS. But ACAS guidance also stipulates that the suspension and existance of any investigation be kept confidential.

I refute the conclusion that the process has not been compromised in the strongest terms and lodge this appeal as follows.

Without my knowledge a disclosure of the suspension and initiation of an investigation was made to staff members in my department, as well as contractors employed by a third party professional services company. This is in contravention of the ACAS guidance. Without proper policy, oversight or controls over the sensitive nature of the disclosure, this information has disseminated rapidly through the wider company workforce.

Through unsolicited contact by ex-colleagues and friends I was made aware that this information has spread external to the company. I have been further made aware that this has become the subject of open speculation, pre-judgement and predjudice inside and outside of the company.

In making the disclosure the company has lost control of this information and breached the confidentiality required of this process. It has not ensured, through it's own actions, that the investigation can be conducted fairly. 

On the possible disciplinary process outlined in the letter of outcome:

- The integrity of any witness statements relied on by the company cannot be verified due to the widespread nature of the disclosure and ensuing speculation, pre-judgment and bias, be it conscious or subconscious.

- My right to be accompanied to any disciplinary hearing has been severely impacted by the undue interference and influence this disclosure has made to people I would have called upon, if required.

- My right to call supporting witnesses to attend the disciplinary hearing has been severely impacted by the undue interference and influence this disclosure has made to people I would have called upon, if required.

By taking this action of disclosure, and the consequences I am having to deal with on a personal and professional level, the company has compromised the process against me, rendering it unfair.

I am unable to assert my rights as part of the process without this undue and unfair interference. There cannot be confidence in the integrity of the investigation

Thank you for the copy of the employee privacy policy you sent and I have read through its contents. Although the points raised in my grievance still stand the effects and consequences of the disclosure are wide-ranging.


Privacy

The privacy policy sets out that my data and work record are confidential and access is on a need to know basis, available only to my line manager, senior management, HR and administrative functions where appropriate. There is no provision for disclosure to the general workforce (as has happened) and would/should require my express consent or the opportunity to restrict this action.

The effects of this are compounded by the presence of external professional service agents (along side staff members employed by them to provide work for the department) and the open nature of the disclosure which has made the existence of the suspension and investigation public knowledge internally and externally to persons unconnected to the company.

The disclosure is a breach of the Privacy policy.


Information Commissioners Office regulations

Even under Legitimate Interests the disclosure would be an uncommon, unexpected action, one not detailed in policy, and reasonably expected to cause damage and/or detriment. The ICO mandates that where an action or disclosure can cause damage or detriment then its procedure must be completed on a case by case basis to validate the action. I have summarised these steps previously (a business justification, risk assessment, safeguards, alternative actions). Where an alternative exists to achieve the same result without impact, this must be the course followed. ACAS provide guidance for alternative actions other than the disclosure.

The disclosure and the process before is in contravention of the ICO regulations.


Confidentiality

As above I would have the expectation that the suspension and investigation would be confidential, given the private, sensitive and prejudicial nature of the action, and as an information gathering exercise, no conclusions or guilt ascribed. The conditions of the suspension and investigation require me to maintain secrecy and confidentiality, yet this has not been reciprocated.

The company, in making this disclosure and not providing adequate safeguards has directly subjected me to personal and professional reputational damage internally and externally to the company. Additionally it has further created a prejudicial and hostile workplace where I am subject to suspicion, prejudice, prejudement and gossip.

This is a breach of the duty of trust and confidence.


Compromised Disciplinary Process

The integrity, fairness and impartiality of the disciplinary process has been compromised. As the disclosure was made within a few days of the start any persons required to give interviews would be subject to prior bias, interference and influence through (and not exclusively by) speculation, prejudice or prejudgement. With the disclosure being public (internal and external to the company) this compromises my ability to call upon a significant number of people to assist me, as accompaniment to interviews and meetings or provide evidence, as examples.

This is a breach of the duty of trust and confidence.


I have not misunderstood how my information is processed but in this regard significant failings have happened creating this situation. As I have stated before it is impossible to now request restrictions where the breach has already occurred. My rights should have enacted at the beginning, not now.

I apologise if I am repeating myself and if these are the issues you are looking into already.

Regards

Simon

Hi Simon

 

Thanks for coming back to me, just to confirm a copy of the Privacy policy has been sent to your home address.

 

As I want to ensure that your concern is being appropriately addressed, it would be helpful to confirm what you would like us to look into. You have told us that you are unhappy that your line manager told colleagues that you were suspended. That is one of the subjects of your grievance and we are looking into it. Is there anything else that you would like us to do in this regard?

 

You have also told us that you do not know how your personal information is being processed. Hopefully, our privacy policy answers those questions. If you have specific questions that are not answered by it, you can ask those questions and I will arrange for them to be answered. You have also told us that you would like us to stop or restrict the processing of personal information about you. Please can you confirm what information you would like us to stop processing or restrict processing so that we can consider whether we are able to do so?


If you are unhappy with the way in which we are collecting and using your personal information, you can complain to our Data Protection Officer, Caroline Hart (caroline.hart@fil.com).

Thanks

 

Louise

Hi Caroline,

I have been directed to you to lodge a complaint regarding the use of my data. Although I am a staff member I am having to contact you via my personal email address for reasons that will become clear. I had lodged this as a formal grievance originally but from correspondance with the HR team I have been made aware this is the correct method. During that process I have received general responses regarding data use but wish to offer you the opportunity to respond officially.

The background for this complaint is as follows.

In June I was subject to suspension pending an investigation into a concer raised. A disclosure of this information was made to team members and contractors employed by a third party professional services company in my department by my line manager, a few days after. This was made without my knowledge and it has been established without proir consultation with either the HR team nor data officers to validate the action.

Compounding the situation no formal guidance was given to those in attendance, relating to the sensitivity and confidentiality of the information (aside to the privacy impact), and has disseminated quickly through the wider workforce. Through unsolicited contact from ex-colleagues and friends I have been made aware this information is now circulating externally to the company.

Although I do not believe the disclosure was made maliciously, the consequences on me have been wide-ranging. I have suffered damage to my personal and professional reputation. I am subject to speculation, prejudice and pre-judgement both internally, and external to the company. This has compromised the workplace against me on making a return to work, on conclusion of the investigation, especially difficult. During what was an already stressful situation I am now suffering from anxiety and other stress related issues.

The HR team responding to my original grievance pointed me to the employee privacy policy. This states that my data and personnel record are confidential, with access available only to my line manager, senior management, HR and administrative functions where appropriate. There is no specific provision for such disclosure to the general workforce, as has happened. As sensitive information, with the potential for harm, there should have been sufficient safeguards and oversight, especially in this situation.

Alternative courses of action to the disclosure are available. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) provide specific guidance on how to manage this situation (allowing me the opportunity to explain my absence from work). This is recognised and long standing guidance which would have mitigated this completely avoidable situation and it's effects on me.

Given the alternative options I can see no reason why my confidential personnel record has been disclosed and I have yet to be provided with a prior valid justification or assessment, under the basis of legitimate interests as stated in the privacy policy. The disclosure appears a clear breach of the privacy policy, alongside priciples of the GDPR (the rights to be informed, restrict and object as examples). 

I submit this complaint for your consideration and await your response. I am unsure of the restrictions of confidentiality regarding my original grievance but the HR advisor who dealt with the case, Louise Walsh (louise.walsh@fil.com), will be able to assist within those parameters.

If, when I receive your response, I would still like to report my concern to the ICO, I will give them a copy of it to consider.

I am happy to discuss any further infomation you require. Please contact me via this email address as I do not have access to the staff email system currently.

Yours faithfully

Simon Papanicolaou
Staff number A589009
